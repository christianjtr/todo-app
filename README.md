# My TODO Application

It's just a proof of concept.

> :bulb: Feel free to add any improvement/sugesstion you consider.

### Comments

This is a conceptual test using the following technologies:

- [React](https://react.dev/).
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/).
- [Bulma](https://bulma.io/).

### ðŸŽ¯ Goals

##### Authorization

- Simple `/login` page to perform a submit operation, a fake **authorization**, and finally we set a **cookie**.
- Redirects to `/home` and **persist the session** even if we close the browser's tab/app.

##### TODO app

Basic TODO app that allows you to: *Add*, *Edit*, *List*, and *Delete* tasks.

###### About the tasks:

- Whenever we close the browser's tab/app, **the tasks should persist**.
- Task should be **removed as soon as we sign out of the app**.

> Tasks are being persisted in `LocalStorage`.
